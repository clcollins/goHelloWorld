GoHelloWorld
============

Just what it sounds like:  Hello World written in Golang

Useful for testing Golang infrastructure, for example, a [Golang Source-to-Image Project](https://github.com/clcollins/golang-s2i), or a [Golang Container Framework](https://github.com/clcollins/goContainerFramework).
